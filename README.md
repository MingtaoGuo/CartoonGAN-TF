# CartoonGAN-TF
Simple code implement the paper of CartoonGAN

## Introduction
This simple code mainly implement the paper about [CartoonGAN](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Chen_CartoonGAN_Generative_Adversarial_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf), which is published at CVPR2018. This paper mainly address the problem of styling the nature images to cartoon by using GANs.

### There are three contributions in the paper:
1. Removing the clear edge of original cartoon images as a new datasets
2. Using high-level feature maps in vgg19 to reconstruct the content
3. Initializing the generator by reconstructing the nature images

## Results of the paper

## Is training ..........
